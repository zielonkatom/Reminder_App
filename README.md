# Reminder_App
Scrape a list of new episodes and email it every x hours. 

Uses selenium since the website I use is protected by cloudflare and smtplib to send emails. 

Easy to customize for personal needs like news, jobs etc. 

Currently using it on my Raspberry Pi that is constantly on to keep me updated every 24 hours.
